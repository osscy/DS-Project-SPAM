# DS-Project-SPAM
This was a my final project for an Introduction course in Data Science. 

The projects goal was to see if one could classify spam and non-spam mails by the text content. This was done by using Naive Bayes and Support Vector Machine. The models was then tested on new dataset to see how well they generalize.
